# Lesson 1 - 10/24/2019## IF statements
## IF statements
If statements in java are one of the core things to learn. Below are some examples of IF statements
```Java
//These are basic if statements with a pre declared variable bool1.
if (bool1 == true) { //This is the first check, what it does is check if bool1 is true. If bool1 is true it will activate the code within the curly braces.
  System.out.println("This will be activated if bool1 is true");

} else { // If bool1 is false then this code will be activated. This is because it is an else statement and when the if statement is false it goes to the next else statement.
  System.out.println("This will be activated if bool1 is false");

}
```
