2. Look around and download stuff
3. The stuff is not very well organized and therefore very unorganized. It may take you a while to find stuff

## [Hackathon Stuffz](https://github.com/Zxtreme03/ComputerScience/tree/master/HackAThon)
Check out this for a small project me and my friends made in 4 hours for a competition.

## [Oopsie OS](https://github.com/Zxtreme03/ComputerScience/tree/master/OopsieOS)
Just a project I've been working on. It's written in C++ and C. It was written for being compiled on macOS. It is just a mock OS made to try and learn exploiting and other things.

# How to get into coding
## Pick a language, I recommend the following languages for beginners
1. [Swift](https://developer.apple.com/swift/) --> For iOS development _**You need a mac**_
2. [Java](https://www.java.com/en/) --> Really just a good starting place for anyone trying to learn
3. [Python](https://www.python.org) --> It can do really everything just takes some time
4. [C++/C](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_(programming_language)) --> These are a little harder to get started with in my opinion but they are still good.
5. [HTML](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML) --> A language used for writing websites, really easy and perfect for beginners.
6. [CSS](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS) --> Goes hand in hand with HTML, helps create beautiful websites.

## What IDE (integrated development environment) should I use?
I recommend some of the following
1. [Xcode](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/) --> Used for iOS development mainly but can be used for other things. 
2. [Atom](https://atom.io) --> This is an all around editor that's good for a lot of things. 
3. [NetBeans](https://netbeans.org) --> This is one of the IDE's I use for Java, it's easy for beginners. 
4. [Eclipse](https://www.eclipse.org) --> Yet another IDE for Java. This one is much more popular than NetBeans. 
5. [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com) --> This one is a good C/C++ editor.
6. [Repl.it](https://repl.it/~) --> This is a really good online IDE, it lets you use tons of different languages. It's really good for people who don't want to commit to installing an IDE onto their computer yet. I recommend this site for just messing around with different code.

## Places to learn
1. [Learn](https://www.learnpython.org) --> This is a good site to just get started with.
2. [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com) --> literally just look things up.
3. [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com) --> This is a good place to ask for help with code or just find code stuff.
4. [Code.org](https://code.org/learn) --> You can start here if you want it's just a good place to start some with some stuff.
5. [Code Academy](https://www.codecademy.com) --> Another good spot to start
6. [Khan Academy](https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/computer-programming) --> Bro, I got another website that helps out a whole bunch

## Amazing youtube channels I highly recommend
1. [Code Bullet](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC0e3QhIYukixgh5VVpKHH9Q), Makes really good AI content.
2. [ThinMatrix](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCUkRj4qoT1bsWpE_C8lZYoQ), Makes good Dev Logs
3. [Michael Reeves](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCtHaxi4GTYDpJgMSGy7AeSw), Makes really good satire content that is fun to watch and get ideas from.
4. [Jabrils](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCQALLeQPoZdZC4JNUboVEUg), Makes good AI content and is really good at explaining how his things work.
5. [William Osman](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCfMJ2MchTSW2kWaT0kK94Yw), Makes good satire content like Michael Reeves. His stuff is more robotics based 
6. [Hopson](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCeQhZOvNKSBRU0Mdg7V44wA), Makes really good coding content, has a lot of explanation videos and is very good at getting you interested in different parts of coding.

## I want to make games but I don't know how to code! What should I do?
### Well first you need to figure out what kind of game you want to make. Do you want a 3D game or a 2D game.
1. I want to make a 3D game --> [Unreal Engine](https://www.unrealengine.com/) or [Unity](https://unity.com)
- Unreal Engine is known for its ability to render beautiful 3D scenes and make stunning games. Most people use Unreal Engine for 3D games because of its easy support for the 3D space. Unreal engine is supported by a drag and drop coding language called Blueprints. This is created by the developers of Unreal and is being constantly updated. If you do not want to sue Blueprints you are able to use C++. Unreal is supported with a marketplace with many free assets to help you get started and is a great place for beginners to start making games. 
- Unity is well known for it's easy support of 2D games and is usually the place most people go when they want to develop a 2D game. Unity can also be used to develop 3D games with ease, it has a very powerful editor and with lots of customizability is a perfect choice for 3D game development. Unity is also backed by a community marketplace where you can get assets and other things to help with your game development.

2. I want to make a 2D game --> [Game Maker Studio](https://www.yoyogames.com/gamemaker)
- Gamemaker Studio is an easy way for people with or without coding experience to start creating games. Gamemaker Studio offers a drag and drop and traditional coding methods for users of all levels, unfortunately this language is a language created by the developers of the program, but it is largely based off of C. Gamemaker studio offers a built in editor for textures and tilesets, allowing for fast and easy level design. Gamemaker studio also offers many helpful features like github integration, an in-engine debugger, in-engine physics, built in sound mixer, a marketplace similar to the ones in unity or unreal engine, and many other helpful features.

### Next do you want to be able to use a drag and drop coding language or do you want to write all the code?
- I want to use a drag and drop coding language --> [Unreal Engine](https://www.unrealengine.com/), Unreal engine has a built in language they call blueprints, this is a modern drag and drop coding language used for making games and is quite powerful.
- I want to write all the code myself --> [Unity](https://unity.com), Unity uses C# to make different parts of games. This allows for you to do things exactly how you want them to be done and gives more control but is generally harder to work with for beginners.

Finally, if you feel like it, you can always code your own game engine in a coding language of your choice, or you can make a game using other existing engines. There are endless combinations for things you can make. Any engine you start with will provide a very good platform to work with, and it is really all up to personal preference and whatever you are most comfortable with.
