- [Mobile CSP](https://course.mobilecsp.org/mobilecsp/course?use_last_location=true)
2. Computer Science A --> **Wokring On It**
- [CSA FOLDER](https://github.com/Zxtreme03/ComputerScience/tree/master/CSA)
3. Resources and stuff that I think are useful to learn to code
4. Plenty of work to sauce
5. Make sure you change some stuff if your going to turn it in

### How to use the website
- To View the Files either 
1. Download the zip on left side
2. Download the tar ball
3. Look at the project on Github
4. Or you can click on the links for the individual folders

- Other stuffz
1. I mean its just a website just click stuff

## Computer Science Principles
1. Go to the [CSP FOLDER](https://github.com/Zxtreme03/ComputerScience/tree/master/CSP) and look around for what you need.
2. Look around and download stuff
3. I mean the rest is pretty easy, just change some stuff then,
4. Sauce my work
5. Boom profit

## Computer Science A
1. Go to the - [CSA FOLDER](https://github.com/Zxtreme03/ComputerScience/tree/master/CSA) and look around for what you need.
2. Look around and download stuff
3. The stuff is not very well organized so stuff is very unorganized. It may take you a while to find stuff
4. Sauce my work
5. Boom profit

## [Hackathon Stuffz](https://github.com/Zxtreme03/ComputerScience/tree/master/HackAThon)
Check out this for a small project me and my friends made in 4 hours for a competition.

## [Oopsie OS](https://github.com/Zxtreme03/ComputerScience/tree/master/OopsieOS)
Just a project I've been working on. It's written in C++ and C. It was written for being compiled on macOS. All it is a mock OS made to try and learn exploiting and other things.

# How to get into coding
Pick a language, I recommend the following languages for beginners
1. [Swift](https://developer.apple.com/swift/) --> For iOS development _**You need a mac**_
2. [Java](https://www.java.com/en/) --> Really just a good starting place for anyone trying to learn
3. [Python](https://www.python.org) --> It can do really everything just takes some time
4. [C++/C](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_(programming_language)) --> These are a little harder to get started with in my opinion but they are still good.

## What IDE (integrated development environment) should I use?
I recommend some of the following
1. [Xcode](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/) --> Used for iOS development mainly but can be used for other things. 
2. [Atom](https://atom.io) --> This is an all around editor thats good for a lot of things. 
3. [NetBeans](https://netbeans.org) --> This is one of the IDE's I use for Java, it's easy for beginners. 
4. [Eclipse](https://www.eclipse.org) --> Yet another IDE for Java. This one is much more popular than NetBeans. 
5. [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com) --> This one is a good C/C++ editor.
6. [Repl.it](https://repl.it/~) --> This is a really good online IDE, it lets you use tons of different languages. It's really good for people who don't want to commit to installing an IDE onto their computer yet. I recommend this site for just messing around with different code.

## Places to learn
1. [Learn](https://www.learnpython.org) --> This is a good site to jut get started with.
2. [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com) --> literally just look things up.
3. [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com) --> This is a good place to ask for help with code or just find code stuff.
4. [Code.org](https://code.org/learn) --> You can start here if you want it's just a good place to start some with some stuff.
5. [Code Academy](https://www.codecademy.com) --> Another good spot to start
6. [Khan Academy](https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/computer-programming) --> Bro, I got another website that helps out a whole bunch

## I want to make games but I don't know how to code! What should I do?
Well first you need to figure out what kind of game you want to make. Do you want a 3D game or a 2D game.
- I want to make a 3D game --> [Unreal Engine](https://www.unrealengine.com/), Unreal Egnine is known for it's ability to render beutiful 3D scenes and make stunning games. Most people use Unreal Engine for 3D games because of its easy support for the 3D space.
- I want to make a 2D game --> [Unity](https://unity.com), Unity is well known for it's easy support of 2D games and is usually the place most people go when they want to develop a 2D game. This does not mean you can't use it for 3D games.

Next do you want to be able to use a drag and drop coding langauge or do you want to write all the code?
- I want to use a drag and drop coding langauge --> [Unreal Engine](https://www.unrealengine.com/), Unreal engine has a built in langauge they call blueprints, this is a modern drag and drop coding langauge used for making games and is quite powerfull.
- I want to write all the code myself --> [Unity](https://unity.com), Unity uses C# to make different parts of games. This allows for you to do things exactly how you want them to be done and gives more control but is generally harder to work with for beginners.

Finally, if you feel like it you can always either code your own game engine in a coding langauge of your choice or make a gsame using other exsisting engines. Their are limitless combinations for things you can make. Any engine you start with will provide a very good platform to work with and it is really all up to personal preference and whatever you are most comforatble with.
