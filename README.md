# Welcome to my Computer Science Page
On here you can find
- Computer Science Principles --> **Complete**
- Computer Science A --> **Uncomplete**
- Resources and stuff that I think are useful to learn to code

## Computer Science Principles
1. Look through the CSP folder found above
2. Download any files that you need or looks at them
3. Sauce my work
4. Boom profit

## Computer Science A
1. Nothing yet sorry

## Hackathon Stuffz
- Check out this for a small project me and my friends made in 4 hours for a competition.

# How to get into coding
- Pick a language, I recomend the following languages for beginners
1. Swift - For iOS development **You need a mac**
2. Java - Really just a good starting place for anyone trying to learn
3. Python - It can do really eveything just takes some time
4. C++/C - These are a little harder to get started with in my opinion but they are still good.

## What IDE (integrated development enviroment) should I use?
I recomend some of the following
- Xcode --> Used for iOS development mainly but can be used for other things. [Link](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/)
- Atom --> This is an all around editor thats good for a lot of things. [Link](https://atom.io)
- NetBeans --> This is one of the IDE's I use for Java, it's easy for beginners. [Link](https://netbeans.org)
- Eclipse --> Yet another IDE for Java. This one is much more popular than NetBeans. [Link](https://www.eclipse.org)
- Visual Studio Code --> This one is a good C/C++ editor. [Link](https://code.visualstudio.com)
