# Welcome to my Computer Science Page

### On here you can find
- Computer Science Principles --> **Complete**
- Computer Science A --> **Uncomplete**
- Resources and stuff that I think are useful to learn to code
- Plenty of work to sauce
- Make sure you change some stuff if your going to turn it in

### How to use the website
- To View the Files either 
1. Download the zip on left side
2. Downlaod the tar ball
3. Look at the projext on github
- Other stuffz
1. I mean its just a website just click stuff

## Computer Science Principles
1. On the right of the screen click download zip file
2. Open up the zip file
3. Look through the zip file to find anything you need
4. Sauce my work
5. Boom profit

## Computer Science A
1. Nothing yet sorry

## Hackathon Stuffz
- Check out this for a small project me and my friends made in 4 hours for a competition.

# How to get into coding
- Pick a language, I recomend the following languages for beginners
1. [Swift](https://developer.apple.com/swift/) --> For iOS development _**You need a mac**_
2. [Java](https://www.java.com/en/) --> Really just a good starting place for anyone trying to learn
3. [Python](https://www.python.org) --> It can do really eveything just takes some time
4. [C++/C](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_(programming_language)) --> These are a little harder to get started with in my opinion but they are still good.

## What IDE (integrated development enviroment) should I use?
I recomend some of the following
- [Xcode](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/) --> Used for iOS development mainly but can be used for other things. 
- [Atom](https://atom.io) --> This is an all around editor thats good for a lot of things. 
- [NetBeans](https://netbeans.org) --> This is one of the IDE's I use for Java, it's easy for beginners. 
- [Eclipse](https://www.eclipse.org) --> Yet another IDE for Java. This one is much more popular than NetBeans. 
- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com) --> This one is a good C/C++ editor.

## Places to learn
1. [Learn](https://www.learnpython.org) --> This is a good site to jut get started with.
2. [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com) --> literally just look things up.
3. [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com) --> This is a good place to ask for help with code or just find code stuff.
