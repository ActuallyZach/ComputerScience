# This is the place where you can find all my other project's I have worked on

## [Hackathon Stuffz](https://github.com/Zxtreme03/ComputerScience/tree/master/HackAThon)
Check out this for a small project me and my friends made in 4 hours for a competition.

## [Oopsie OS](https://github.com/Zxtreme03/OopsieOS)
Just a project I've been working on. It's written in C++ and C. It was written for being compiled on macOS. It is just a mock OS made to try and learn exploiting and other things.

## [Brute Force Tester](https://BruteForce.zxtreme03.repl.run)
This is a project I worked on to test how long a brute force attack would take on a password.
